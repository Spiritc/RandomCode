Step 1:
     We declare variables and retrieve information from the console

Step 2:
     There are two ways to enter the size of glasses:
     a. on one line with dividers ' ' or/and ',' , we can add more 
        characters or symbols as dividers depending on the format of the input
     b. or one glasse size per line

Step 3:
     We call a function "Rounds" with a parameter array of cup sizes and returns 
     how many times can we find 3 identical glasses next to each other

Step 4:
     Creating variables and copying the array to work with

Step 5:
     "While" and "For" cycles that make the necessary checks on the array 
     and adds the found sequences to "count" variable

Step 6:
     Program ends with printing the number of glasses that brothers drink
